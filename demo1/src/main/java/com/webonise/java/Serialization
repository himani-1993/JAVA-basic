Serializzation
- Actual state to byte streams


What happens in reality

Algo

 - write description of class cOb to which object belongs say ob written in writeObject().
 - write desc of its parent class of cOb
 - write data associated with the object ob
 - write desc of objects say ob1 defined in cOb class
 - write data associated with the objects eg ob1, ob2


Serial version ID-

    - SerialVersionUID is used for version control of object.
    - Consequence of not specifying serialVersionUID is that when you add or modify any field in class then already serialized class will not be able to recover because serialVersionUID generated for new class and for old serialized object will be different.

Transient and Static:

    - if you don't want any field to be part of object's state then declare it either static or transient based on your need and it will not be included during Java serialization process.
